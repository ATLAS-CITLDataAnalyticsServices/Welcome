The ATLAS-CITL Data Analytics Services Group provides consulting on Survey Research, Data Analytics, and Data Preparation. We provide data management consulting and survey research support to instructors, researchers, and students at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.  Our data services include assisting with the creation of data sets for faculty, instructors, and students for use in their teaching and research. Through a partnership with the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences we provide support in the use of statistical software and statistical analysis to members and students of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

Our Github account was created with the main goal of socializing our work. We will be working mostly in our own project but we will be always open to collaboration with students, faculty and other institutions. Consultants of the ATLAS-CITL Data Analytics Services Group will be posting technical documentation of statistical methods, helpful tips and resources, based on frequently asked questions coming from clients, students and faculty member of UofI.
